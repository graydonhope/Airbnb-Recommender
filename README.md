# Airbnb-Recommender (iOS Application)

Provides the user with a list of desireable rooms and hosts based on previous selections.

Implemented K-Nearest Neighbours and used the kNeighbours method to gather similar listings in order to make helpful recommendations to the user. 

After the model is finalized, it will be converted into Core ML format to deploy in the iOS app.
